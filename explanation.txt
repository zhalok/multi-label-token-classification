the main strategy that is followed for predicting two type of tags with a single model used here is
the model will be predicting a tensor of size 36 for each token 
first 15 values of the tensor will be predicting the pos and the rest will be predicting ner 

we will split the prediction tensor into two subarrays from 0 to 14 and from 15 to 35 

then we will apply argmax in each of the subarrays to predict both of the tags

the training strategy applied here is to resample each text twice with two set of token tags 

"sample text" : ["pos-tag-1","pos-tag-2"] ["ner-tag-1","ner-tag-2"]

this is how each sample after preprocessing the dataset

after resampling 

"sample text": ["pos-tag-1","pos-tag2"]
"sample text": ["ner-tag-1","ner-tag-2"]

the main intuition behind following this approach is the model should automatically learn to predict the probability of one item in the first 0 to 14 tensor and one item in the second 15 to 35 tensor to be high (both around 50%) for each token.
